CamelJockey 
=========== 

Overview
--------
CamelJockey is a lightweight unit testing framework for OCAML. It provides some simple facilities for building and bundling tests together, as well as running them and collecting output in nice ways. 

CamelJockey will get your testing off the ground, without bringing too much bloat or confusion. As your project grows, it's easy to build off of CamelJockey, enabling more complex conditional testing. 

Examples
